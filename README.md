First things first I‘m still a minor acting like an adult in soc med.
 I am highly interactive but sometimes I‘m not due to the change of my moods and personalities over the time.
My simple hobbies are : Drawing‚ sleeping‚ eating‚ 
I‘m always online on this account because I don‘t really have things to do js scrolling through facebook and other more online apps.
I’m in a lot of fandoms : Cookie Run Kingdom (CRK)‚ Hazbin Hotel (HH)‚ Harry Potter (HP)‚ Steven Universe (SU)‚ Countryhumans (CHS)‚ Flamingo‚ DSMP (a bit‚ i joined late at ts fandom)‚ Aphmau‚ ETC.
I do arts too‚ Traditional and Digital. But mostly i draw traditionally because i can focus with peace and quiet‚ o draw on digital rarely because i get bored easily and my hands really hurts when u grind drawing for hours.
I'm a pansexual 1!1!!2!2!  ( i mostly like girls :3)
I often simp about everything i see in social media i know ts is random but meh...
As i said earlier my mood changes very quickly sometimes i feel kind for an hour and will randomly be sulking at the corner or having an tantrum, i cannot control my emotions so sometimes i let things happen freely since i can't control my emotions.
I do arts’ (Traditional and Digital) I don't really post my arts’ here ‘cause i feel lazy to give a caption to that art (js kidding I'm just shy to post it..)
